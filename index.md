# Hi, I'm Marcos.

An Electronic Engineer focused on **analog circuits** and **embedded intelligence**.

I enjoy creating reliable circuits that blend hardware precision with digital capabilities. My work ranges from power regulation and PCB design to firmware for microcontrollers.

<br>

## Tech I work with

* **Hardware/PCB:** KiCad (schematic + layout), analog/power design, lab bring-up and measurements.
* **Firmware:** Embedded C/C++, ESP32 and ARM-class MCUs, debugging and instrumentation.
* **IoT/Systems:** GCP + Kubernetes observability (logs/metrics), service monitoring, automation tooling.
